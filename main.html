  <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</li>
    <li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase its total run time</li>
    <li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</li>
  </ul>
